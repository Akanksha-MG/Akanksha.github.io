									<p>As the world faced the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in late 2019, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, spread rapidly across borders, affecting communities, economies, and healthcare systems on a global scale. During this crisis, data analysis has proven essential for understanding the pandemic's dynamics, uncovering insights into its spread, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. I conducted a brief analysis of the COVID-19 dataset from ourworldindata.org to identify meaningful patterns and trends, contributing to our collective knowledge of this significant event.</p>

									<p>In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a comprehensive COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard using Tableau. This interactive dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights into the spread and impact of the virus, leveraging data from reliable sources to inform decision-making and public health strategies.

										The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations that track key metrics such as infection rates and mortality rates across different regions, it also shows the relationships between the cases and deaths. 
										
										The dashboard allows for an intuitive and user-friendly experience by utilizing Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities. Users can filter data. This tool is invaluable for health professionals, policymakers, and researchers seeking to monitor the pandemic's trajectory and develop data-driven responses.
										
										Overall, the COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard serves as a critical resource in our ongoing efforts to combat the virus, providing clear and actionable insights through sophisticated data visualization techniques.</p>

									<p>The Health Insurance Analysis Dashboard, created using Tableau, offers a comprehensive view of health insurance claims data. This interactive platform provides insights into various aspects of health insurance, aiding in better decision-making and strategic planning.

										The dashboard features a scatter plot showing the correlation between claim amounts and age, highlighting potential age-related patterns. It includes a bar chart ranking the top 10 cities by total claim amounts, allowing users to identify geographic areas with the highest insurance claims. Another bar chart illustrates the impact of hereditary diseases on claim amounts, offering insights into how genetic conditions affect insurance costs.
										
										A pie chart compares claim amounts between smokers and non-smokers, underscoring the impact of smoking on health insurance claims. Additionally, a bar chart displays claim amounts by job title, revealing correlations between different occupations and insurance claims.
										
										The dashboard is interactive, with filters that let users explore specific segments of the dataset, such as smoker status and job title. This dynamic tool provides real-time updates based on applied filters, making it easy to gain tailored insights.
										
										Overall, the Health Insurance Analysis Dashboard empowers stakeholders with a deep understanding of health insurance claims, enhancing decision-making, operational efficiency, and risk management strategies.</p>

									<p>This project centers on analyzing customer churn for a bank, aiming to uncover demographic insights, financial impacts, and the relationship between customer tenure and loyalty. By leveraging advanced data analytics tools such as Excel and Power BI, we aim to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition. Our analysis begins with demographic insights, examining how age, gender, income, and geographic location influence churn rates. This helps in understanding which segments are more likely to leave and why.

										Next, we assess the financial impact of churn, calculating the loss in revenue from departing customers and identifying high-value customers at risk. By quantifying this impact, we can prioritize retention efforts and develop targeted strategies to mitigate financial losses.
										
										Additionally, we explore the link between customer tenure and loyalty. By analyzing how the duration of a customer's relationship with the bank affects their likelihood to stay, we can identify key loyalty drivers and develop programs to enhance customer retention. Our findings will be visualized through comprehensive dashboards, providing the bank's management with actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies. Ultimately, this project aims to reduce churn rates, enhance customer loyalty, and secure the bank’s revenue streams by implementing data-driven, targeted retention initiatives.</p>

									<p>This project focuses on AtliQ Hardware, a company experiencing rapid growth but struggling with competition due to its reliance on limited Excel-based data. As a data analyst, I have harnessed the advanced analytics capabilities of Power BI to enable data-driven decision-making and enhance the company's competitive edge. Utilizing tools such as Excel, Power Query, Power BI, DAX, and DAX Studio for optimization, we have transformed how the company analyzes and interprets data. Key business metrics now tracked include Gross Sales, Net Invoice Sales, Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit, Deductions, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-to-Go (YTG) figures, and Market Share. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive business analytics platform that provides detailed insights across various dimensions of the business. The platform will feature distinct views tailored for finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive management, each offering specific analytical capabilities to drive data-informed decision-making. This integration of advanced data analytics provides AtliQ Hardware with a comprehensive and actionable view of its performance, driving strategic insights and fostering a data-centric culture to maintain its competitive advantage in the market.</p>
